this is a very strange film that was long thought to be forgotten it s the story of two american army buddies william boyd aka hopalong cassidy and louis wolheim and their adventures as they manage to escape from a german prison camp during wwi however as this is a comedy the duo manage to make the most round about and stupid escape accidentally boarding a train to constantinople to be placed in a turkish prisoner of war camp on the way they manage to escape once again and end up in quite the adventure meeting sexy mary astor along the way as far as the film goes it was a rather funny script and despite being a silly plot it worked rather well the chemistry between boyd and wolheim worked and the film managed to be quite entertaining oddly however the film managed to beat out harold lloyd s film speedy for an oscar for best direction for a comedy a category no longer used as speedy was a superior film in most ways it s one of lloyd s best films still it s well worth a look especially if you love silent films by the way director milestone and louis walheim would team up just a few years later for another wwi picture the great all quiet on the western front a film that is definitely not a comedy i admit the great majority of films released before say are just not for me of the dozen or so major silents i have viewed one i loved the crowd and two were very good the last command and city lights that latter chaplin circa so i was apprehensive about this one and humor is often difficult to appreciate uh enjoy decades later i did like the lead actors but thought little of the film one intriguing sequence early on the guys are supposed to get de loused and for about three minutes fully dressed do some schtick in the background perhaps three dozen men pass by all naked white and black wwi and for most their butts part or full backside are shown was this an early variation of beefcake courtesy of howard hughes
